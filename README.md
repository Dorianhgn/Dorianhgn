## Hi there 👋

🎓 I’m currently in my 4th year at INSA Toulouse, studying Applied Mathematics with a strong interest in AI and its real-world applications.

🚀 I’m passionate about Machine Learning, especially where it intersects with **interpretability**, **ethics**, and **mathematical understanding of models**. I'm currently working on:

- 🧠 [Rebuilding a Transformer architecture from scratch](https://github.com/Dorianhgn/GPT) to deeply understand how LLMs work internally.
- 📚 Applying concepts from Christoph Molnar's *[Interpretable Machine Learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)* in a [course project](https://github.com/Dorianhgn/ProjetML4A/).
- 💡 Exploring DeepSeek’s architecture and its improvements on efficiency and scalability.

⚙️ I'm especially interested in **explainable AI (XAI)** — I was introduced to it during my Erasmus in Slovenia and plan to further explore the field both theoretically and practically.

🔬 I’ve also had a taste of research during a project with **CERFACS Toulouse**, focused on multilevel Monte Carlo methods — [project & paper here](https://github.com/Dorianhgn/Log-Euclidean-MLMC-Estimator/blob/main/PAPER.pdf). This experience sparked a strong interest in scientific inquiry and rigorous methodologies.

🏃‍♂️ On the side, I also train and compete in **high jump at a national level**, and I’m curious about the intersection of **AI and sports performance** — another domain where interpretable, human-centric AI has potential.
